### Idea

So many of us wants to listen to various amazing podcasts out there, but due to time constraints we are not able to give so much time and attention to listen to them. What if its possible to read the transcript of the podcast in a text version, that's struck my mind. 
I decided to create an web app to **Read the podcasts - PodText**.
